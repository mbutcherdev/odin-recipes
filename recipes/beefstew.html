        Worcestershire sauce and sprinkle over the 2 crumbled beef stock cubes
      </li>
      <li>
        Gradually stir in 600ml of hot (not boiling) water, then add the stewing
        beef and bring to a simmer<br />
        Optional: Lightly coat the beef in flour, brown in a low-medium heat
        frying pan to lock in more flavour before adding to the dish
      </li>
      <li>
        Cover and put in the oven for 2:30hrs, uncover and cook for a further
        30mins until the meat is tender
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Directions (slow cooker):</h3>
    <p>
      This is a really easy method, takes roughly 5-10 minutes to prep and will
      be ready when you get home!
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat slow cooker on high (around 5-10 minutes will be fine, keep the
        lid on!)
      </li>
      <li>Chop the onion and carrots, set aside</li>
      <li>
        Heat a frying pan on low-medium, brown the diced beef in batches(lightly
        coat in flour to thicken the flavour)
      </li>
      <li>
        Add 600ml boiling water put the two stock cubes, plus the Worcestershire
        sauce in and mix well
      </li>
      <li>
        Place the onions, carrots and beef into the slow cooker. Add the
        potatoes and pour the stock in, stir everything in and ensure the meat
        is covered
      </li>
      <li>Add the butter, puree and bay leaves and give it a stir</li>
      <li>
        Cook on high for 4 hours, or low for 8 hours.<br />
        You'll want the meat to be tender and the sauce to thicken
      </li>
      <li>
        Leave the lid on for the entire cooking time, it does not need to be
        stirred.<br />
        If the gravy is not thick enough when you're wanting to eat, mix one
        teaspoon cornflour with a tablespoon of room temperature water <br />
        Transfer the sauce only to a saucepan and add the mix<br />
        Ensure you mix well and bring it back to a boil until you reach the
        desired thickness. Readd it to the slow cooker, stir well and serve!
